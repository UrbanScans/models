## Info

Bust-monument of Georgi S. Rakovski, Borisova Gradina Park - reserve of the garden-park art (SG No. 96 of 1988) The monument is part of the Alley of the Famous Bulgarians (№8). The bust of Rakovski, created for Boris's Garden in 1928, finds its place in the center of his native Kotel in 1930. Liked by the public as the embodiment of this "crazy dreamer, image impossible, the bust was repeated several times and in 1933 placed on a rock near the hut "Fonfon" on Vitosha and in the yard of the eponymous school in Sofia (artificial stone), and on October 9, 1938 the monument in Vidin was consecrated. In his letter Ivan Lazarov writes "In the bust of Rakovski I conveyed the breadth of ideas and activities that we all feel in this giant of the Renaissance. It radiates that inner burning and businesslike manifestation that we know about Rakovski. ” According to K. Konstantinov, the head was cut "with simple, bold lines."
